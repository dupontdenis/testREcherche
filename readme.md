# countCharacterOccurrences Function Refactoring

This document describes ten different versions of the `countCharacterOccurrences` function, which counts the number of occurrences of a specific character in a string.

1. **For Loop Version:** This version uses a traditional for loop to iterate over the string and increment a count variable when the current character matches the target character.

2. **While Loop Version:** This version uses a while loop to achieve the same result as the for loop version. It's a more traditional approach and might be more familiar to programmers with a background in languages that don't support for loops.

3. **For-Of Loop Version:** This version uses a for-of loop, which is a more modern feature of JavaScript. It's more readable than the for loop and while loop versions, but it might not be supported in older JavaScript environments.

4. **ForEach Method Version:** This version uses the `Array.prototype.forEach` method to iterate over the string. It's a more functional approach and can lead to cleaner code, but it might be slower than the loop versions for large strings.

5. **Filter Method Version:** This version uses the `Array.prototype.filter` method to create a new array that only includes the characters that match the target character. It then returns the length of this new array.

6. **Reduce Method Version:** This version uses the `Array.prototype.reduce` method to count the number of characters that match the target character. It's a more functional approach and can lead to cleaner code, but it might be slower than the loop versions for large strings.

7. **Match Method Version:** This version uses the `String.prototype.match` method with a regular expression to find all occurrences of the target character. It's a more concise approach, but it requires understanding of regular expressions.

8. **Split Method Version:** This version uses the `String.prototype.split` method to split the string into an array of substrings at each occurrence of the target character. It then returns the length of this array minus one.

9. **Recursion Version:** This version uses recursion to count the number of characters that match the target character. It's a more academic approach and can lead to cleaner code, but it might cause a stack overflow for large strings.
